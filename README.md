Remember to replace 'username', 'password', 'https://yoursharepointsite.com/sites/your-site-name', 'Shared Documents/Your Folder', and 'yourfile.ext' with your actual SharePoint login credentials, site URL, folder path, and file name respectively.

Please note that, for security reasons, it's better to not hardcode your credentials directly into your script. Consider using environment variables or a secure method to store and retrieve these sensitive data.

Also, be aware that the SharePoint server configuration, version, and user permissions can affect the ability to perform certain actions, such as downloading files. Be sure to have the proper permissions and correct path to the file you want to download.



In the script provided, site_url is a string that represents the URL of the SharePoint site you are trying to access.

SharePoint is typically used by businesses and organizations to create websites. These sites can be used as a secure place to store, organize, share, and access information from any device.

The structure of a SharePoint site URL typically looks something like this:

https://yourcompanyname.sharepoint.com/sites/yoursite

Here:

https://yourcompanyname.sharepoint.com is the domain that your organization uses for SharePoint. If you're using SharePoint Online (part of Office 365), this URL will typically include sharepoint.com. If you're using an on-premises version of SharePoint, this URL may be different.

/sites/ is a common path in the URL that SharePoint uses to indicate a collection of related SharePoint sites.

yoursite is the specific site in the site collection that you want to access.

So in the script, site_url should be replaced with the URL of the SharePoint site that you want to access.

If you are unsure what the URL is for your SharePoint site, you can usually find it by navigating to the site in your web browser and looking at the URL in the address bar.




The folder_path is a string that specifies the path to the folder where your desired file resides within the SharePoint site.

In SharePoint, files are stored in libraries, and within these libraries, you can have folders and subfolders. The folder_path needs to represent the hierarchy of these libraries and folders/subfolders to reach your desired file.

For example, consider a SharePoint document library named 'Shared Documents'. Within this library, there's a folder named 'Reports', and inside 'Reports', there's a subfolder named '2023'. If the file you want to download is in this '2023' subfolder, your folder_path would be:

folder_path = 'Shared Documents/Reports/2023'

Remember, SharePoint uses '/' as a delimiter to separate parts of the path. The path should start with the document library name and then include any subsequent folders or subfolders, all separated by '/'.

Make sure to replace 'Shared Documents/Your Folder' in the script with the actual path to the folder containing the file you want to download.
